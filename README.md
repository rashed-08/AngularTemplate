# AngularTemplate
The AngularTemplate is aimed to reduce time while setup angular project.

# How it works? 
AngularTemplate will help you to headache creating angular project and start from scratch. The AngularTemplate uses default **Bootstrap 4.3**. In case if you are interested update bootstrap version or want to use **Material UI** then simply remove **Bootstrap 4.3** and then take nessesary step to implement them.

# Installation 
\
Goto desired file system and open terminal to create folder.\
`mkdir ProjectName`
\
\
Goto the folder\
`cd ProjectName`
\
\
Clone the project\
`git clone https://github.com/rashed-08/AngularTemplate`
\
\
To download all the dependencies\
`npm install` (for debian user, if you get error then run `sudo npm install`)\

# Run Project
\
Goto application folder\
`cd ~/AngularTemplate`
\
\
Now run this command,\
`ng serve -o`\
(Use '-o' flag for open up new tab in browser)
\
N:B:\
This is my own setup approach. May you can choose other project structure.\
